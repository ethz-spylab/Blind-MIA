Editorial note:

      _The Claverings_ was published first in serial form in _The
      Cornhill Magazine_ from February, 1866, to May, 1867, and
      then in book form by Smith, Elder and Co. in 1867.

      The _Cornhill_ version contained 16 full-page illustrations
      and 16 quarter-page vignettes by Mary Ellen Edwards, a
      respected and successful illustrator. The Smith, Elder first
      edition contained only the full-page illustrations. Both the
      full-page illustrations and the vignettes are included in
      this e-book. They can be seen by viewing the HTML version of
