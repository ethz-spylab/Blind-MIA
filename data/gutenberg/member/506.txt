CASTLE RACKRENT


by Maria Edgeworth



With an Introduction by Anne Thackeray Ritchie



     [Note: The body of this novel contains a lot of footnotes
     and many references to the Glossary at the end.  The
     footnotes (which are sometimes quite long) have been
     inserted in square brackets near to the point where they
     were referred to by suffix in the original text.  The
     entries in the Glossary have been numbered, instead of being
     listed with a page number as they were in the printed book;
     they are also referenced with a note in square brackets near
     the point where there was a suffix in the original.

     Italics have been replaced by capitals.

     The pound sterling symbol has been replaced by 'L'.

     This text and the Introduction were taken from an edition
     published by Macmillan and Co. in 1895.]
