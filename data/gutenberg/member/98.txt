Editorial Note:

      _Phineas Redux_ was published first in serial form in the
      _Graphic: An Illustrated Weekly Newspaper_ from July, 1873,
      to January, 1874, and then in book form by Chapman and Hall
      in 1874.

      The _Graphic_ version contained 26 illustrations by Frank
      (Francis Montague) Holl (1845-1888). Twenty-four of those
      were published in the Chapman and Hall first edition and are
      included in this e-book. They can be seen by viewing the
