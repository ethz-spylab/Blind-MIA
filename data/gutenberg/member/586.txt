  "Conceive him now in a man-of-war;
     with his letters of mart, well armed,
   victualed, and appointed,
      and see how he acquits himself."
                   --FULLER'S "Good Sea-Captain."

NOTE. In the year 1843 I shipped as "ordinary seaman" on board of a
United States frigate then lying in a harbor of the Pacific Ocean.
After remaining in this frigate for more than a year, I was discharged
from the service upon the vessel's arrival home. My man-of-war
experiences and observations have been incorporated in the present
volume.

New York, March, 1850.
