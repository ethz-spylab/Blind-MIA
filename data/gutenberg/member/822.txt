  These few stories of a good old
  woman I dedicate to the
  memory of

  A. R. S. M.

  who sat beside me while I wrote
  them and offered many happy suggestions.




  "Her face, deep lined; her eyes were gray,
  Mirrors of her heart's continuous play;
  Her head, crowned with a wintry sheet,
  Had learned naught of this world's deceit.
  She oft forgot her own in others' trials,
  And met the day's rebuffs with sweetest smiles."
