          Dedicated to Constance Lytton

          "Glory of warrior, glory of orator, glory of song,
          Paid with a voice flying by to be lost on an endless sea--
          Glory of virtue, to fight, to struggle, to right the wrong--
          Nay, but she aim'd not at glory, no lover of glory she:
          Give her the glory of going on and still to be."

          Tennyson.
