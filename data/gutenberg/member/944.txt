  "_Spring's hands are always full of rosy flowers,
    Unopened buds to deck each field and tree.
  We love and watch them through the long, sweet hours,
    Not for the buds, but what the buds will be._

  "_Life's hands are full of buds. She comes on singing,
    With radiant eyes, across Youth's golden gate;
  We smile to see the burden she is bringing,
    And for the Summer are content to wait._"
