[Transcriber's Note:

This text of _The Comedy of Errors_ is from Volume I of the nine-volume
1863 Cambridge edition of Shakespeare. The Preface (e-text 23041) and
the other plays from this volume are each available as separate
e-texts.

General Notes are in their original location at the end of the play.
Text-critical notes are grouped at the end of each Scene. All line
numbers are from the original text; line breaks in dialogue--including
prose passages--are unchanged. Brackets are also unchanged; to avoid
ambiguity, footnotes and linenotes are given without added brackets.
In the notes, numerals printed as subscripts are shown inline as
F1, F2, Q1...

Texts cited in the Notes are listed at the end of the e-text.]
