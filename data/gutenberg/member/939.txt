[Transcriber's note: The accentuation and spelling of the original
has been retained. This may at times seem variable: e.g., manati and
manati. Greek transliterations appear between + signs. This symbol:
[=o], which appears once to represent the letter o with a line above it.
Italics are indicated by under-scores, as in this example: _NEW YORK:_.
