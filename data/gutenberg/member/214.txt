PREFACE


It may seem almost superfluous to explain that this book does not deal
with the whole of Yorkshire, for it would obviously be impossible to get
even a passing glimpse of such a great tract of country in a book of
this nature. But I have endeavoured to give my own impressions of much
of the beautiful coast-line, and also some idea of the character of the
moors and dales of the north-east portion of the county.

I have described the Dale Country in a companion volume to this,
entitled 'Yorkshire Dales and Fells.'
