A CLUSTER OF GRAPES


A BOOK OF TWENTIETH CENTURY POETRY



By

GALLOWAY KYLE



    _"Hee doth not onely shew the way, as will entice anie man to
    enter into it: nay he doth as if your journey should lye through a
    faire vineyard, at the verie first, give you a cluster of grapes,
    that full of that taste, you may long to passe further."_



LONDON: ERSKINE MACDONALD
1914
