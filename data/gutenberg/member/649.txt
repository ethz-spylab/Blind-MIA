DEDICATION

PREPARER'S NOTE

This was typed from an Everyman's Library edition. It seems that Dakyns
died before Cyropaedia could be included as the planned fourth and final
volume of his series, "The Works of Xenophon," published in the 1890s by
Macmillan and Co. The works in that series can all be found in Project
Gutenberg under their individual titles. The complete list of Xenophon's
works (though there is doubt about some of these) is:

  Work                                   Number of books

  The Anabasis                                         7
  The Hellenica                                        7
