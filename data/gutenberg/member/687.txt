Transcriber's note:

   Page numbers in this book are indicated by numbers enclosed in
   curly braces, e.g. {99}.  They have been located where page
   breaks occurred in the original book.  For its Scripture Index
   and its General Index, a page number has been placed only at
   the start of those sections.

   Footnotes have been renumbered sequentially and moved to the
   end of their respective chapters.  The book's Index has a
   number of references to footnotes, e.g. the "96 n." entry under
   "Assyrians."  In such cases, check the referenced page to see
   which footnote(s) are relevant.

   The Greek words in this e-book have been transliterated
   according to Project Gutenberg's Greek How-To.  Such words are
   indicated with surrounding underscores.  Underscores are also
   used to indicate italicization of words, but in this e-book
   such words are always English words.
