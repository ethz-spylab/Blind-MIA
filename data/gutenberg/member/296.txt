 Transcriber's Notes:
 1) Some treaty signatures are unclear and have been marked and/or
    best-guessed. Original signature images can be seen in the html
    version.
 2) The breve has been rendered as [)c] and the macron [o=]
 3) Text following ^ is superscripted.
 4) Unusual and inconsistent spelling of place/names have been left as
    in the original.
