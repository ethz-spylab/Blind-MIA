Page numbers explicitly referred to in the text are marked at their
beginning by "[page ##]" on a separate line.  The location of the
illustrations in the text are marked by "[amdg_##.gif]" on a separate
line.  I hope this etext inspires a wider interest in the origins of
photography and in the modern practice of the Daguerreian Art.


[Updater's note: In this version, the above page numbering convention
has been replaced by "{##}" sequences placed in line with the
surrounding text.]
