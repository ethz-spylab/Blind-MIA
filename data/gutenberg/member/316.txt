SERMONS ON THE CARD AND OTHER DISCOURSES
by Hugh Latimer


INTRODUCTION.


Hugh Latimer, a farmer's son, was born about the year 1491, at
Thurcaston, in Leicestershire.  He was an only son, with six sisters, who
were all well cared for at home.  He was a boy of fourteen when sent to
Clare College, Cambridge.  When about twenty-four years old, he had
obtained a college fellowship, had taken the degree of Master of Arts,
and was ordained Priest of the Roman Church at Lincoln.  In 1524, at the
age of about thirty, he proceeded to the degree of B.D., and on the
occasion of his doing so he argued publicly for the Pope's authority
against opinions of Melancthon.  Thomas Bilney went afterwards to
Latimer's rooms, gave him his own reasons for good-will to the teaching
of Melancthon, and explained to him his faith as a Reformer in a way that
secured Latimer's attention.  Latimer
