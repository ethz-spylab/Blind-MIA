PREFACE


Norman Leslie of Pitcullo, whose narrative the reader has in his hands,
refers more than once to his unfinished Latin Chronicle.  That work,
usually known as "The Book of Pluscarden," has been edited by Mr. Felix
Skene, in the series of "Historians of Scotland" (vol. vii.).  To Mr.
Skene's introduction and notes the curious are referred.  Here it may
suffice to say that the original MS. of the Latin Chronicle is lost
