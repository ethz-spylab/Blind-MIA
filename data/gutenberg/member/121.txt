Editorial note:

      Anthony Trollope travelled through the United States from
      August, 1861, to May, 1862, visiting all the states that
      did not secede except California. This book is partly a
      journal of his travels and partly his description of American
      customs and culture including industry, education, government,
      military affairs, religion, transportation, and even
      hotels. To an American of today it provides a revealing and
      fascinating picture of life at the time.

      The book was first published in two volumes by Chapman & Hall
      in 1862.

      Project Gutenberg has the other volume of this work.
