 THE
 DOROTHY BOOKS
 By EVELYN RAYMOND

 These stories of an American girl by an American author have made
 "Dorothy" a household synonym for all that is fascinating. Truth and
 realism are stamped on every page. The interest never flags, and is
 ofttimes intense. No more happy choice can be made for gift books, so
 sure are they to win approval and please not only the young in years,
 but also "grown-ups" who are young in heart and spirit.
