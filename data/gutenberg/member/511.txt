Transcriber's notes:

      Obvious printer's errors have been corrected. All other
      inconsistencies are as in the original. The author's
      spelling has been retained.

      Page 170: The end punctuation of "What means this affectation of
      _naivete_." has been changed to "What means this affectation of
      _naivete_?".

      All illustrations are sketches of (possibly) Butterflies.
