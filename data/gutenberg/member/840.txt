COMEDIES OF COURTSHIP

By Anthony Hope



  "It is a familiar fact that the intensity of a passion varies
   with the proximity of the appropriate object."
    Mr. Leslie Stephen, 'Science of Ethics'

  "How the devil is it that fresh features
   Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?"
    Lord Byron, 'Don Juan'

NOTE

"The Wheel of Love," published in Scribner's Magazine during the past
year, and "The Lady of the Pool," both protected by American copyright,
are here printed for the first time in book form. The four other
stories appeared without their author's consent or knowledge, with
their titles changed beyond recognition, and combined with other
unauthorized material, in a small volume printed by an American firm.
They are here given for the first time in their proper form and by my
authority.
