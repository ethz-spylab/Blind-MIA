[Transcriber’s Note:

The printed book had two kinds of headnote: keyword and mileage.

“Keyword” headers, noting the places and subjects mentioned on the page,
have been placed before the most appropriate paragraph.

Each itinerary gives the “miles from” {starting point} and “miles to”
{ending point}, with the numbers printed in the left and right corners
of each paragraph. For this e-text the numbers are shown in {braces}
before the beginning of each paragraph; the place names are given at
the beginning of the itinerary, and repeated as needed. Paragraphs
describing side excursions do not have mileage information.

The hotel rating symbols are explained at several random points in the
text, though not in the introductory section
