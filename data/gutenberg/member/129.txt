    “As long as the names of Garrick, of Johnson, and of Seward shall
    endure, Lichfield will live renowned.”—_Clarke_.

    “Biography, the most interesting perhaps of every species of
    composition, loses all its interest with me when the shades and
    lights of the principal characters are not accurately and faithfully
    detailed.”
