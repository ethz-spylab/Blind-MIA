Preface.


The Sleeping Bard was originally written in the Welsh language, and was
published about the year 1720.  The author of it, Elis Wyn, was a
clergyman of the Cambro Anglican Church, and a native of Denbighshire, in
which county he passed the greater part of his life, at a place called Y
las Ynys.  Besides the Sleeping Bard, he wrote and published a book in
Welsh, consisting of advice to Christian Professors.  The above scanty
details comprise all that is known of Elis Wyn.  B
