Old Times at Otterbourne.


Not many of us remember Otterbourne before the Railroad, the Church, or
the Penny Post.  It may be pleasant to some of us to try to catch a few
recollections before all those who can tell us anything about those times
are quite gone.

To begin with the first that is known about it, or rather that is
guessed.  A part of a Roman road has been traced in Otterbourne Park, and
near it was found a piece of a quern, one of the old stones of a hand
mill, such as was used in ancient times for grinding corn; so that the
place must have been inhabited at least seventeen hundred years ago.
