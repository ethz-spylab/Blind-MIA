[Transcriber’s Note:

This e-text includes characters that will only display in UTF-8
(Unicode) text readers:

  œ  (“oe” ligature)
  ā ē ī ō ū ȳ ǣ  (vowels with macron or “long” mark)
  ǽ  (æ with accent)
  ȝ  (yogh)
  þ̷ þ̸ (thorn with line, typically abbreviating “that”)

Most of these letters are rare and occur only in the quotations from
Old English. If any of them do not display properly--in particular,
if the diacritic does not appear directly above the letter--or if the
apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage,
make sure your text reader’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set
to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the default font.

Book sizes such as 8^o (printed with superscript “o”) have been changed
to 4to, 8vo, 12mo.

In a few selections, italics were used to indicate missing words or
letters. These have been shown wit
