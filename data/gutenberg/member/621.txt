|TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:                                                   |

|The original text uses macrons (a letter with a bar over it) in some of|
|the names. These have been replaced with [=x] (where x is the original |
|letter).                                                               |

|There is Greek in this text which has been transliterated into Arabic  |
|letters.                                                               |
