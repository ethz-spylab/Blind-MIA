  To
  M. M. D.,

  who, during the last two years
  of our residence in London,
  practiced the teachings of this book
  before I taught them:

  to redeem the lives,
  that were most estranged from virtue,
  and most lost to hope.




Love feels no burden, regards not labours, would willingly do more than
it is able, pleads not impossibility, because it feels that it can and
may do all things.

THOMAS A KEMPIS.
