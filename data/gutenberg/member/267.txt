A Treasury of College Verse


Selected by


Frederic Lawrence Knowles

_Editor of "The Golden Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics," etc.


_1897_

REVERED MEMORY
OF A
GREAT SCHOLAR AND GREAT TEACHER
WHOM I WAS ONCE PROUD

Frances James Child,

We only sing of youth and joy,
And love,--the credo of the boy!_
