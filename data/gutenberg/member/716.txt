    | TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE                                           |

    | In this plain text version, small capitals have been         |
    | rendered as ALL CAPS, bold using =equals signs= and italics  |
    | _usually using underscores_. However, the original used      |
    | italics to highlight certain letters within words where      |
    | these were intended to help with remembering numbers and     |
    | dates according to the "Analytic substitution" memory        |
    | method. For legibility, these have been rendered using       |
    | {c}u{rl}y {br}ac{k}e{ts}.                                    |
