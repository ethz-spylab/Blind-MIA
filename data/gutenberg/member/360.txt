[This text is intended for readers who cannot use the "real" (unicode,
utf-8) version of the file. A few characters such as "ae" have been
unpacked; fractions are written out as "1-1/2", and symbols such as
degree signs have been expanded.

The Table of Contents, Index, and all cross-references use paragraph
numbers, shown in (parentheses).

Braces have been added to a few long fractions that were originally
printed on two lines.

The numbers in expressions such as R2, R3, R4 were printed as
superscripts.]
