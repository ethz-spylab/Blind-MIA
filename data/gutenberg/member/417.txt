Editorial note

This book is about the seduction of a young girl by the heir to an
earldom, the resulting illegitimate pregnancy, and the young nobleman's
struggle to decide whether to marry or to abandon the girl--certainly
not the usual content of Victorian novels.

Trollope is believed to have written _An Eye for an Eye_ in 1870, but
he did not publish it until the fall of 1878, when it appeared in
serial form in the _Whitehall Review_, followed by publication of the
entire book in 1879. The reason for delaying publication is unknown,
although Trollope might have been concerned about the book's reception
by the public, given its subject matter and the hostile reception in
1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's _Ruth_, which dealt with the same subject.
