NEW FACES

[Illustration: "THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT," HE RETORTED. "SHE KNOWS
THAT I SHALL MARRY HER."]


    "Oh give me new faces, new faces, new faces
    I have seen those about me a fortnight or more.
    Some people grow weary of names or of places
    But faces to me are a much greater bore."

    _Andrew Lang._
