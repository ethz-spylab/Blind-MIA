Transcriber's note:

      Obvious minor typesetting errors in punctuation have been
      silently corrected.

      One sentence which began  "The gale had cracked a very
      large bow..." has been changed for consistency with the
      rest of the paragraph to read "The gale had cracked a very
      large bough..."
