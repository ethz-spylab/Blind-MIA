  [Transcriber's Note:

  Illustrations in this picture book are not individually marked.
  Each color plate has a short poem written within the plate; these
  are not listed in the Table of Contents. The inconsistent sequence
  of "Dick Whittington" and "Puss in Boots", and the spelling of "Jack
  and Jill" (or "Gill") are unchanged.]
