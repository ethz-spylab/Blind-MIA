E-text prepared by Al Haines



Transcriber's notes:

   In the original book, each odd-numbered page (except for the first
   page of a chapter) had its own header.  In this e-book, each
   chapter's headers have been collected into an introductory
   paragraph at the start of the chapter.

   The original book contained many Greek words.  They have been
   transliterated according to the Project Gutenberg "Greek How-To,"
   and have been indicated with surrounding underscores.

   Italicised words in the original have also been indicated with
   underscores, but such words are always English.

   Bold-face text in the original book has been enclosed between
   plus (+) signs in this ebook.

   Footnotes have been renumbered consecutively and moved to the
   end of their host chapter.
