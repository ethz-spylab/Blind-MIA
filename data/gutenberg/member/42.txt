{Transcriber's notes:
    ~Bold~ text is surrounded by tildes ~, _italic_ text by underscores _.
    +Greek+ text is transliterated and surrounded by plus signs +.
    oe ligatures have been unpacked.
    Letters with overscores are represented as {=a}, {=e}, {=o}.
    The use of  e and e to indicate stresses is inconsistent, as is
    the use of ae ligatures. No changes have been made to the original.
