SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A PRIVATE PUPIL

BY

FRANK E. SMEDLEY

          "How now! good lack! what present have we here?
          A Book that goes in peril of the press;
          But now it's past those pikes, and doth appear
          To keep the lookers-on from heaviness.
          What stuff contains it?"

          _Davies of Hereford_
