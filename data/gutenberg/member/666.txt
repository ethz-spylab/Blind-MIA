THE MEMORABILIA

Recollections of Socrates

By Xenophon




Translated by H. G. Dakyns





     Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a
     pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,
     and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
     and property in Scillus, where he lived for many
     years before having to move once more, to settle
     in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.

     The Memorabilia is a recollection of Socrates in
     word and deed, to show his character as the best
     and happiest of men.
