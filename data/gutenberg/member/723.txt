Contents and have indicated section breaks with three asterisks.
Also I have made the following spelling changes: Chapter II:

"course in leaves" to "coarse in leaves". Also the sentence
beginning "This is a retrospective day for your soul" is incomplete.

"reproductions". Chapter VI: "sitting ud" to "sitting up". Chapter
VII: "Chapter V" to "Chapter VII". A Few Toasts: "murmer" to "murmur".

Entertainment Suggestion: "calender" to "calendar". Characters
in Finger Nails: "strickly" to "strictly". Strange Wills: "There
have been many" to "There have not been many", and "MacCaig" to
MacCraig". Something to Remember: "Spender Percival" to "Spencer
