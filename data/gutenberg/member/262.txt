[Transcriber’s Note:

This e-text includes a few characters that will only display in UTF-8
(Unicode) text readers, including

  ȝ (yogh)
  œ (oe ligature)

There are also a few lines of Greek, and some rarer characters:

  ſ (long s, used in one short selection)
  ł (l with bar, also used only in one selection)
  m̅ (m with overline, used only in the Boke of Nurture)

If any of these characters do not display properly, or if the quotation
marks in this paragraph appear as garbage, make sure your text reader’s
“character set” or “file encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may
also need to change the default font. As a last resort, use the Latin-1
version of the file instead.


This very long book has been separated into independent units, set off
by triple rows of asterisks:
