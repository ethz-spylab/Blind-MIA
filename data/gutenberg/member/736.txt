  TO WALTER HAMPDEN

  "There's a lot o' brothers
  knockin' abaht as people
  don't know on, eh what?
  See wot I mean?"




"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
in darkness even until now.  He that loveth his brother abideth
in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness
hath blinded his eyes. . . .  If a man say, I love God, and
hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his
brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath
not seen?
