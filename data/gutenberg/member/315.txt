THE NIBELUNGENLIED

By An Unknown Author

Translated by Daniel B. Shumway


Originally written in Middle High German (M.H.G.), sometime around 1200
A.D., although this dating is by no means certain. Author unknown.

The text of this edition is based on that published as "The
Nibelungenlied", translated by Daniel B. Shumway (Houghton-Mifflin Co.,
New York, 1909).

PREPARER'S NOTE: In order to make this electronic edition easier to use,
the preparer has found it necessary to re-arrange the endnotes of Mr.
Shumway's edition, collating them with the chapters themselves and
substituting page references with footnote references. The preparer
takes full responsibility for these changes.--DBK.
