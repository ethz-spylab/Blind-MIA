MARJORIE

BY

Justin Huntly McCarthy

_Author of_ "IF I WERE KING"

     _Oh Marjorie, my world's delight
     Your yellow hair is angel-bright,
     Your eyes are angel-blue.
     I thought, and think, the sweetest sight
     Between the morning and the night
     Is just the sight of you._

New York

R. H. RUSSELL
