DAYS OFF

And Other Digressions

by

HENRY VAN <DW18>







[Illustration: Our canoes go with the river, but no longer easily or
lazily.]



I do not count the hours I spend
In wandering by the sea;
The forest is my loyal friend,
Like God it useth me:

Or on the mountain-crest sublime,
Or down the oaken glade,
O what have I to do with Time?
For this the day was made.

                    --RALPH WALDO EMERSON
