Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

A number of words in this book have both hyphenated and non-hyphenated
variants. For the words with both variants present the one more used
has been kept.

Obvious punctuation and other printing errors have been corrected.

The book cover was modified by the Transcriber and has been put in the
public domain.

The Transcriber would like to point out to what are considered a couple
of translation inaccuracies from the original Italian language version.

In page 59 the text reads:

"I know of no marsh capable of provoking in human pulses a fever more
violent that that which at times steals up to us from the shadows of a
silent canal."

While in the Italian edition (Publisher: Milano Fratelli Treves; year:
1900), the text reads:

"Io non conosco palude capace di provocare in polsi umani una febbre
pi√π violenta di quella che sentimmo talvolta venire verso di noi
all'improvviso dall'ombra di un canale
