                     THE CHEMICALLY PURE WARRIORS

                           BY ALLEN KIM LANG

                  They conquered the planet and they
                    owned it outright. The trouble
                 was--they didn't dare set foot on it!

From the head of the platoon Lieutenant Lee Hartford signaled Sergeant
Felix, busy policing up stragglers at the rear, that he was taking
over. Hartford tongued the volume-setting of his bitcher to "Low" and
softly sing-songed to his three dozen troopers: "_Your girlfriend's
just an hour away; there's a time to soldier and a time to play._ Pick
it HUP, HUP, HUP! 'Toon, tain-HUT.'
