                         MARY JANE’S MEMOIRS.

                          By GEORGE R. SIMS.

             _WITH A PHOTOGRAPHED PORTRAIT OF MARY JANE._


“A quite Defoe-like revelation. It is, in effect, a series of social
sketches drawn by a keen and humorous observer. Can be heartily
recommended to all and sundry.”--_Globe._

“A very entertaining autobiography.... Mary Jane has a faculty for
observing character, and a power of delineating its movements and
development, not distantly related to those of Mr. Sims himself. Mary
Jane has so full a fund of exciting incident to draw upon, and so
pleasant a manner of philosophizing, in her homely way, upon the ups and
downs of a servant’s life, that should she ever take the field as a
novelist independently of her present sponsor, he will have a formidable
rival to contend with.
