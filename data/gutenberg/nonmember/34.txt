THE AUTHOR


Rutherford Montgomery would rather write than do anything else in the
world. Most of his books are about animals and the wilderness he knows
so well. As a boy, Mr. Montgomery would listen to the tales told by
hunters, and his favorite sport then and now is going into the woodland
and sitting quietly on a log, observing the children of the wild. He is
a watcher, not a hunter.

Mr. Montgomery was born in North Dakota, and taught school for
ten years in Wyoming and Colorado after graduating from Colorado
Agricultural College. He saw service in the United States Flying Corps
in World War I. Later, he was a county judge in Colorado and held state
offices there. He now lives in Los Gatos, California.
