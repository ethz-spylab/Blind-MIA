                                  THE
                            PRIME  MINISTER

                                   BY
                            HAROLD  SPENDER

                    “Who, if he be called upon to face
              Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
              Great issues, good or bad, for human kind,
              Is happy as a Lover; and attired
              With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired.”
                          The Happy Warrior.
