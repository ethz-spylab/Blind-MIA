Transcriber's note:

Obvious printer errors corrected silently.

Hyphenation has been rationalised. Inconsistent spelling (including
accents) has been retained.

Small capitals have been replaced by full capitals. Italics are
indicated by _underscores_.

Running headers, at the top of each right-hand page, have been converted
into Sidenotes and moved in front of the paragraphs to which they refer.
