                        By LAURA JEAN DOUGLAS.


=MODERATOR= says:--“Some of the most exquisite prose we have read for many
a day.”

=IRISH NEWS= (Belfast) says:--“In the ten ‘Idylls’ which Miss Douglas
contributes, we have a group of the sweetest prose poetry possible.... A
gallery of lovely pictures.... A thing of beauty and a joy for ever....
The turn-out of the book is equal to anything of the same kind produced
in London.”
