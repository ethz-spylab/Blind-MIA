    MOTTO

    "This minute that comes
    to me over the past
    Decillions.
         There is no better than it
    And now. What behaves well
    In the past or behaves well
    To-day is not such a wonder.
    The wonder is always and
    Always how there can be
    A mean man or an infidel."

    WALT WHITMAN.
