Introductory note.


During an expedition made in Central Asia and Northern China in the
years 1906-1908 I had the opportunity of spending some days among the
Sarö and Shera Yögurs, two small tribes which under the common name
of "Huang-fan" (the yellow barbarians) inhabit the northern reaches
of the Nanshan mountains in the district of Kanchow-Hsuchow, and
part of the plain at its foot. In the hope of assisting in spreading
some light upon these imperfectly known races, I offer some extracts
from my journal, a vocabulary of words noted down parallely, as used
by both tribes, some anthropological measurements and a number of
photographs, some of which were taken during my expedition, others
representing an ethnographical collection which I made.

In making the vocabulary, the words have been taken down phonetically.
