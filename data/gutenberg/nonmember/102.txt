Transcriberâ€™s Notes


Italic text is enclosed in _underscores_; small-caps text has been
changed to all-caps.

Bracketed page numbers, such as [Page 17], at the beginning of each
Poem, were added as a Search aid by Transcriber, as the Table of
Contents is in alphabetical, rather than page number sequence.
