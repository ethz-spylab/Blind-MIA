                          Transcriber’s Notes

    This e-text is based on the print version of ‘The Works of Thomas
    Hood, Vol. II,’ published in 1882. Inconsistent and uncommon
    spelling and hyphenation have been retained; punctuation and
    typographical errors have been corrected. Footnotes have been moved
    to the end of the sections in which their respective footnote
    anchors are situated.

    Small caps have been changed to uppercase letters.
