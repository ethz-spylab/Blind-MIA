                                 COURT

                                  OF

                               CHANCERY:

                           A Satirical Poem.

                                  BY

                        REGINALD JAMES BLEWITT,

                         LATE OF LINCOLNS INN.

    When knaves and fools combined o’er all prevail,
    When justice halts, and right begins to fail;
    E’en then the boldest start from public sneers,
    Afraid of shame, unknown to other fears;
    More darkly sin, by satire kept in awe,
    And shrink from ridicule, if not from law. BYRON.
