FAMOUS CAVALRY CHARGES.

BY RICHARD BARRY.


COOKE'S CAVALRY AT GAINES'S MILL.

It was a strange fact that those in authority at Washington and those in
charge of the immediate conduct of the Union armies in the field did not
early in the war recognize the immense importance of a well-organized
cavalry.

The idea that cavalry should be used merely as an auxiliary arm of the
service was held by General Scott, and those who immediately followed
him in command seem to have held the same opinion.

The small bodies of troopers of both the regular and volunteer branches
of the mounted service were attached to various isolated army corps.
