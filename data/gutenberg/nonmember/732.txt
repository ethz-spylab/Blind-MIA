                          Transcriber’s Notes

Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation and accents have been standardised but all other
spelling and punctuation remains unchanged.

The precise location of footnote 256 is speculative since it is not
indicated in the original.

Italics are represented thus _italic_.
