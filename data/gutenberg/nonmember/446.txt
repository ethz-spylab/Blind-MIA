+Transcriber's Notes+

 - This book is set forth as a reference for Baptist churches to
   discuss their history, organization, polity, and operations. The
   book itself has a small form factor, suitable to be carried in a
   suit coat pocket.
 - The author's perspective is quite partisan; many arguments are
   introduced in favor of his preferred methods and against
   alternatives.
 - Detailed information on the Transcriber's changes are listed after
   the text.
