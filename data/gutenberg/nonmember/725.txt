THE BORZOI-GYLDENDAL BOOKS


The firm of Gyldendal [Gyldendalske Boghandel Nordisk Forlag] is the
oldest and greatest publishing house in Scandinavia, and has been
responsible, since its inception in 1770, for giving to the world some of
the greatest Danish and Norwegian writers of three centuries. Among them
are such names as Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Pontoppidan, Brandes,
Gjellerup, Hans Christian Andersen, and Knut Hamsun, the Nobel Prize
winner for 1920, whose works I am publishing in America.

It is therefore with particular satisfaction that I announce the
completion of arrangements whereby I shall bring out in this country
certain of the publications of this famous house. The books listed below
are the first of the _Borzoi-Gyldendal_ books.
