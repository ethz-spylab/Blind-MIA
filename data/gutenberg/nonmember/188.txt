                              THE RAIDER

                             BY DON BERRY

                  _He was a hunter with a Cause that
                 transcended all law. But, now, could
                  the Cause forgive him his service?_

They dropped the raider on the night side, less than thirty miles from
Thanlar, the capitol city. The dark, slim ship drifted silently to the
ground, discharged its passenger and lifted again, moving slowly like
a great shark in the night. On the way out into space, it was caught
by the defense screens of Thanlar and disappeared in a gout of flaming
energy that lit up the entire night sky.
