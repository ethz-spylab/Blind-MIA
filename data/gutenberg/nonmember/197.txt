[Illustration: This is Peggy’s own drawing of what happened in the
first Adventure of the Ring. Everyone is very frightened in it. Nurse
has just sat down on seeing the Giant, and has dropped Peggy’s brown
holland frock behind her.

Peggy drew the frock very carefully, spreading it out flat on the floor
to get it exactly right. Mother helped her with the Giant’s knee, and
with the table. All the rest she did herself. She knows Nurse is too
small, but she was too busy getting her surprised enough to remember to
make her bigger. Peggy is behind the Giant wondering what to say. The
little round things near the Giant’s foot are the broken bits of the
cup and saucer, and the black dots are the currants in the cake. The
curls in the Giant’s beard were the most fun to do.]
