Transcriberâ€™s Notes

  A few words in relation to era/dialect have been retained e.g. tho,
  possest, stopt, dropt, slipt, distrest.

  The frontispiece spelling of the Queen of Belgium is Elisabeth,
  as shown in the photo with her signature. Throughout the main
  text however, it has been spelt Queen Elizabeth. These spellings
  have been left as printed.

  In the Appendix, where there are two or more illustrations per page,
  the words (Top), (Middle), (Bottom) have been used, to indicate the
  link with the text and illustration.

  p.292: changed 4 to _d_

  Printer errors have silently been corrected.
