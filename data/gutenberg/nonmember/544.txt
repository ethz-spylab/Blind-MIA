BY THE SAME AUTHOR

THE DRIVER

“A good, rapidly moving novel of ‘Wall Street’ methods, written by a
man who knows.”

  --_Springfield Republican_

“The book is among the most absorbing which we have read recently.”

  --Heywood Broun in _The World_

“I feel as did Mark Sullivan, who said: ‘Garet Garrett has written one
of the great novels of the day.’... That is beside the point to one who
wants to study man and his work.... The thing that impresses me is its
fidelity to life.”

  --_Bernard M. Baruch._
