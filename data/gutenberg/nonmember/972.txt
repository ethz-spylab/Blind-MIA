Transcriberâ€™s Notes

Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation have been standardised but all other spelling and
punctuation remains unchanged.

The precise location of footnote 37 is speculative since it is not
indicated in the original.

Al-Bertuni is only mentioned once in the book, with an anchor to a
footnote which is not present. The anchor has not been included.

The first footnote to chapter VII has no anchor, nor any mention of the
apparent topic within the chapter so it has not been indexed.

Italics are represented thus _italic_, and superscripts thus y^e.
