                       The National Park Service

Delaware is the only state that does not have a National Park. It has
over 600 Nationally Registered Historic Places.

The National Park Service is in charge of protecting some of the most
special places in America. These places have been set aside for the
American people (and visitors from all over the world) for their natural
beauty, historic value, and unique resources.
