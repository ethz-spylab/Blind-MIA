  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

  Footnote anchors are denoted by [number], and the footnotes have been
  placed at the end of each chapter. Four digit items such as [1466] are
  not footnote anchors but refer to a year.

  A superscript is denoted by ^x or ^{xx}, for example L^d or Hon^{ble}.

  Gothic font is indicated by double plus signs, ++in gothic font++.

  Macrons over e and u are displayed correctly as ē and ū. Some latin
  abbreviations are shown in the original text with an overline, for
  example Hiberniæ when abbreviated is shown as Hibniæ with ibni
  overlined. This overline is indicated in the etext using [= ] giving
  H[=ibni]æ.

  Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ¼ ¾; there are no other fractions
  in this book.
