Transcriber’s Note


This book was transcribed from scans of several different copies of the
original found at the Internet Archive. The typesetters of the original
book represented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with
circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron
throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the
original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings but I’ve left
variant spellings alone. Some words and names, like _yojana_ and
_Gāruda_, were spelled two different ways in the same text. I have
spelled them consistently to avoid confusion.
