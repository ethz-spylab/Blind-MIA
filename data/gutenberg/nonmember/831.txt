A Novel




By EDMUND YATES

AUTHOR OF "BLACK SHEEP."







"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?"

                              SHAKESPEARE.
