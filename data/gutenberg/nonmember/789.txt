BEWICK’S SELECT FABLES.


                            “Is not the earth
  With various living creatures, and the air
  Replenished, and all those at thy command
  To come and play before thee? Knowest thou not
  Their language and their ways? They also know,
  And reason not contemptibly: with these
  Find pastime.”—_Paradise Lost_, b. viii. l. 370.
