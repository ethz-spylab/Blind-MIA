Transcriber's note:

Obvious printer errors corrected silently.

Correspondence included in the 'Memoir' has been indented. A notice of
another book by one of the editors has been shifted to the end.

Small capitals have been replaced by full capitals. Italics are

My share in this book has been the writing of the brief introductory
Memoir, with the exception of the pages relating to Regent Square and
