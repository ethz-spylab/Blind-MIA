The Colored People of Chicago


[Sidenote: =Colored People in County Jail=]

In the course of an investigation recently made by the Juvenile
Protective Association of Chicago upon the conditions of boys in the
County Jail, the Association was much startled by the disproportionate
number of colored boys and young men; for although the colored people
of Chicago approximate 1/40 of the entire population, 1/8 of the boys
and young men and nearly 1/3 of the girls and young women who had been
confined in the jail during the year were negroes.
