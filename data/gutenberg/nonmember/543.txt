                   LIFE, TRAVELS, AND LITERARY CAREER
                                   OF
                             BAYARD TAYLOR.

                And crown the hero when his deeds are done:

            In the slow process of the doubtful years.
            Who seeks too eagerly, he shall not find:
            Who seeking not pursues with single mind
            Art’s lofty aim, to him will she accord,
            At her appointed time, the sure reward.”
