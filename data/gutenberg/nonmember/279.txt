  "_We rode along and finally Montezuma Castle loomed up.... I was very
  much excited and filled with awe.  We just sat and gazed.  Finally I
  got my little wooden camera out and took a picture of the Castle from
  horseback."

Many early visitors thought this cliff dwelling was a "castle" built by
Aztec refugees for their emperor, Montezuma--thus the name!
