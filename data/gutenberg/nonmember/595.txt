                             INTRODUCTION.


In the previous pamphlets, “English Methods of Birth Control” and “Dutch
Methods of Birth Control,” one finds a duplication of the methods given
in the first pamphlet, “Family Limitation.” The French methods of Birth
Control are so nearly the same that I have decided not to duplicate
these again, but to give instead a list of the books and pamphlets
issued by the French League, and also cuts or pictures of some of the
articles they have for sale at their headquar
