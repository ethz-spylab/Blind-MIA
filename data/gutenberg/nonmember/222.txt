PREFACE


Those acts which go to form a person’s influence are little things,
but they are potential for good or bad in the lives of others. Though
they are as fleeting as the breath which gave them, their influence is
as enduring as they reach. But may we strive to scatter loving,
cheering, encouraging words, to soothe the weary, and awaken the
nobler feelings of those with whom we daily come in contact.

The cause of great joys, like those of sorrow, are few and far
between, but every day brings us much good if we will but gather it.
All successful men are remarkable, not only for general vigor, but for
their attention
