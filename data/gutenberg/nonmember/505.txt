                                Preface


I hope that no suggestion of any strange land that may be conveyed by
the title will scare readers away from this book; for, though some
chapters do indeed tell of Elfland, in the greater part of them there is
no more to be shown than the face of the fields we know, and ordinary
English woods and a common village and valley, a good twenty or
twenty-five miles from the border of Elfland.

                                                           LORD DUNSANY
