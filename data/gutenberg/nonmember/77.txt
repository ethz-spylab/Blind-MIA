Transcriber’s Note: Some words at the bottom of page 8 were omitted
from the original printing and have been filled in by comparison with
another edition of the book, published by S. W. Partridge & Co. in
London c. 1905:

“Sydney! Sydney!” Mildred said reprovingly, “don’t you [remember what
mother was] saying to you only yesterday?

That other edition also gave the name of the illustrator, Wal Paget.
