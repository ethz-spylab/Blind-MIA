“The SPECTATOR FORCE”— In “GAY NINETIES” This book does not carry the
actual work of these pictured Associates—but it does bring them into the
writings. The Author owes much to them for helpful co-operation during
our newspaper regime—and maybe also, if the truth were known, they have
been, in a manner, quite helpful in the actual writing.

The book is dedicated to the memory of them.
