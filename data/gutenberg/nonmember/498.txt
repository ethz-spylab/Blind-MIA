                           Transcriber’s Note


This book uses a number of astronomical symbols, including signs of the
Zodiac (♈, ♉, ♊, ♋, ♌, ♍, ♎, ♏, ♐, ♑, ♒, ♓), symbols for planets (☿, ♀,
⊕, ♂, ♃, ♄) and for the sun and moon (☉, 🌑︎). If these characters do not
display correctly, you may have to use an alternative font, such as
Arial Unicode MS or DejaVu.

When italics were used in the original book, the corresponding text has
been surrounded by _underscores_. Mixed fractions have been displayed
with a hyphen between whole number and fraction for clarity.
Superscripted characters are preceded by ^ and when more than one
character is superscripted, they are surrounded by {}.

Some corrections have been made to the printed text. These are listed in
a second transcriber’s note at the end
