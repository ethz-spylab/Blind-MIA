Welcome to George Washington Carver National Monument’s Junior Ranger
Program!

George Washington Carver National Monument is a special place that needs
people like you to take care of it. By becoming a Junior Ranger you can
help preserve national parks so that future generations may also enjoy
them!

Explore the park and have fun while you complete the steps to become a
Junior Ranger. When you are finished, take this booklet to the Visitor
Center and have a Park Ranger or other staff member sign your
certificate and issue your badge.

Thank you for helping to preserve national parks. Remember to have fun!
