  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

  Old English font is denoted by =equals signs=.

  In the original text a narrative change from one battalion to another
  was indicated by some additional blank space. In this etext two blank
  lines similarly indicates this transition.

  Footnote anchors are denoted by [number], and the footnotes have been
  placed at the end of each chapter or section.

  A superscript is denoted by ^x or ^{xx}, for example Capt^n or
  27^{TH}. The original text had a dot under the superscripts; this dot
  has been removed in the etext.

  Six town names with āo ending have been changed to ão for consistency.

  Some other minor changes to the text are noted at the end of the book.
