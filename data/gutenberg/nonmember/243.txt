  TRANSCRIBERâ€™S NOTE

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

  Bold text is denoted by =equal signs=.

  These lectures each had a set of associated slides, a complete
  list of which can be found on pages 143-152 at the end of the
  book. These slide sets were sold separately and are not part of
  the book. Some of the slides (those highlighted in =bold= in the
  slide list) were inserted as illustrations in the original book,
  and the captions of these illustrations are reproduced in this
  etext.

  The numbers in the right margin of the etext are the numbers of
  the associated slides. Several of these margin slide numbers are
  in parentheses ( ) to indicate that this particular slide is being
  shown for a second time at this point in the lecture.

  There are no Footnotes in this bo
