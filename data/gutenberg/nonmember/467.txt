Transcriber's note:

Obvious printer errors have been corrected. Hyphenation has been
rationalised. Inconsistent spelling (including accents and capitals) has
been retained.

Small capitals have been replaced by full capitals. Italics are
indicated by _underscores_. Transliterated Greek is indicated by
+plus signs+.

Running headers, at the top of each right-hand page, have been converted
into Sidenotes and moved in front of the paragraphs to which they refer.

The anchor for Footnote 615 is missing and has been inserted at a likely
position.
