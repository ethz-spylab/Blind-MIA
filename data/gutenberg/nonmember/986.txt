Transcriber’s note:

      Text printed between _underscores_ represents italic text.

      Superscripted text is represented by ^{text} (i.e., a caret
      character followed by the superscripted character(s) enclosed
      by curly brackets).

      Small capitals have been replaced with ALL CAPITALS.

      Some characters might not display properly in this UTF-
