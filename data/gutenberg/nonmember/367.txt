Transcriber’s Notes


Italics text is enclosed in _underscores_; crossed-out text on pages
36 and 76 is enclosed in \backslashes\; and superscripted text in the
first lines of the first page is preceded by carets, such as D^r.

Bracketed page numbers, such as [Page 81], at the beginning of each
Fable, were added as a Search aid by Transcriber, as the Table of
Contents is in alphabetical, rather than page number sequence.
