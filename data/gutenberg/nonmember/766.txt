A DEDICATION

WITH THIS BOOK OF VERSE

  _When you and I were little tiny boys
    We took a most impertinent delight
  In foolish, painted and misshapen toys
    That hidden mothers brought to us at night._

  _Do you that have the childâ€™s diviner part--
    The dear content a love familiar brings--
  Take these imperfect toys, till in your heart
    They too attain the form of perfect things?_
