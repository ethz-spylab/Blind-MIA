[Illustration: Eunice Lake, northwest of Mount Rainier. The lake lies in
a small bedrock basin that was scoured out by a glacier between about
15,000 and 20,000 years ago. The rounded green slopes at the far edge of
the lake are underlain by rock that has been smoothed and grooved by
glacier ice. This side of Mount Rainier rises to Liberty Cap, which
hides the true summit of the volcano.]
