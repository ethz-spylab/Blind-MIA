DEMOCRACY AND DIPLOMACY

(3s. 6d. net)

BY

ARTHUR PONSONBY


“It is the completest statement of the case for the democratic control
of foreign affairs which has been published, and contains a mass of
facts whose value cannot be exaggerated. We owe Mr. Ponsonby a great
debt for this work.”--_Labour Leader._

“... Mr. Ponsonby’s main contention is one which may and should receive
the hearty assent of many who disagree with him in detail. He strongly
urges the necessity in dealing with foreign affairs of ensuring the
co-operation and approval of the great mass of the people. He is
manifestly quite right.”--The late LORD CROMER in The _Spectator_.
