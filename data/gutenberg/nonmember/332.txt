THE

CHILDREN OF THE ABBEY.

A TALE.

BY

REGINA MARIA ROCHE.




                             A matchless pair;
   With equal virtue formed, and equal grace,
   The same, distinguished by their sex alone:
   Hers the mild lustre of the blooming morn,
   And his the radiance of the risen day.--THOMSON.

THE

CHILDREN OF THE ABBEY.




CHAPTER I.

  "Yellow sheafs from rich Ceres the cottage had crowned,
     Green rustles were strewed on the floor;
   The casements sweet woodbine crept wantonly round,
     And decked the sod seats at the door."--CUNNINGHAM.
