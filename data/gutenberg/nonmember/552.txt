Transcriber’s Notes:

    A small number of obvious typos have been corrected. Except for
    these corrections, the spelling and punctuation of the book have
    not been changed.

    Underscores are used for italic markup; the three words that
    end this sentence _are in italics_.

    There are 113 footnotes in the source book marked by characters
    such as * and †. In this e-book each footnote has a unique marker
    that consists of a number enclosed by square brackets. All the
    footnotes have been moved to the end of the main text where each
    footnote is headed by its marker.
